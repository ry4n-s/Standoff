# Standoff
2D 2-player Arcade Shooter in Turing

In order to run, Turing 4.1.1 must be downloaded. There are three distinct maps, a regular cowboy showdown, the moon, and a not so nice place. The cowboy showdown is the 'normal' mode, the moon map has low gravity and a curved bullet trajectory, and the the not so nice place has the players get a very fast fire rate. The scoring system is based on who gets the most shots on the other player.
